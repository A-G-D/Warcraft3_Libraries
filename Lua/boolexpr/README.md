# BoolExpr

boolexpr.lua v1.0.0 by AGD | <https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/330817>

## Description

Boolean expressions, a fast and lightweight alternative to the native 'boolexpr' type, with the most minimal overhead possible in execution, and a capability to pass arguments upon evaluation and propagate them to all the leaf node expressions of the boolean expression tree.

There are also additional boolean expression logics namely, the 'All' and 'Any' logical evaluators, which are equivalent to 'And' and 'Or' respectively, except that the later are only used to evaluate exactly 2 expresions - the left and right expressions, while the former are used for any arbitrary number of expressions.

## Requirements

- None
